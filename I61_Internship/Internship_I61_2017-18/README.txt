#I61 Internship

##Purpose:

	Create several autonomous systems that perform the following functions:
		1. Manage a water system that controls the water level in a water supply tank.
		2. Manage a power supply system that probably uses a car battery. The charge level of the battery should be monitored.
		3. Some type of notification system that notifies the user when something goes wrong.
