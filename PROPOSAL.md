## Raspberry Pi2 based GPS

## Needs and Opportunities
Humanity needs an alternative GPS option. Using a raspberry pi to run a GPS will provide a cheap alternative option to systems like Garmin or any common application that can be run off of a phone.

## Audience / Clients / Users
All people who would like to track their location or the location of someone or something else will be potential customers who can take advantage of my product. The product will be especially useful in places where they do not have access to things like internet or another GPS system. It will be useful for collecting data and saving data over a long period of time.

## Product
The product will be a raspberry pi that is capable of acting as a GPS. It will specifically be capable of storing data over an extended period of time independently without user management. Pros are that it will be light, cheap, and small.

## Timeline
I plan to have the hardware in hand and ready for me to begin working on my code by the end of February. I am leaving some time here for me to learn how to use the file system in linux as well as set up the various connections between the raspberry pi and whatever other computer I plan to be using. By April 1 I plan to have the raspberry pi hooked up to the GPS unit and receiving information from the GPS. By April 29 I will have all of my data collection and organization done for the raspberry pi and will be ready to begin working on the software and visual aids that I will implement to make the data more readable.

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Deliverable 1 |
| April 1       | Deliverable 2 |
| April 29      | Deliverable 3 |

## Reality Check
I am going to need a Raspberry Pi 2, either the Zero($5), B($37), or the B+($35). In addition to these things, I will need, a charger($5), a microSD card($5), an HDMI cable($4), a GPS module($40), as well as a breadboard with wires and a connection board($10).

## Conclusion
This project, besides providing me with the opportunity to apply what I know to the physical world, will allow me to have the time and the rescouces to learn more about how to translate ideas from mere concepts into physical reality. Furthermore it will provide an alternative answer to the question that has plagued humanity since the beginning. "Where the heck am I?"
