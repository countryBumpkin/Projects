SUBSYTEM BREAKDOWN:
	
	CONTROLLER:
		Raspberry Pi: $5-36
			Less expensive, may be less power efficient

		Arduino: $30-50
			Can it provide all the functions required? May have desirable size to price and function ratio
	

	SENSOR:
		Ultrasonic: $3-25
			$3 version not durable, can buy pvc protected version(submersible) for $25

		Submersible Pressure/Transducer: $30-500
