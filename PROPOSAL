# Proposal: Handheld GPS
## Raspberry Pi2 based GPS	
Garrett Wells

## Needs and Opportunities
Humanity needs an alternative GPS option. Using a raspberry pi to run a GPS will provide a cheap alternative option to systems like Garmin or any common application that can be run off of a phone.

## Audience / Clients / Users
All people who would like to track their location or the location of someone or something else will be potential customers.

## Product
The product will be a raspberry pi that is capable of acting as a GPS. It will be capable of storing data over an extended period of time independently without user management.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that\u2019s
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Deliverable 1 |
| April 1       | Deliverable 2 |
| April 29      | Deliverable 3 |

## Reality Check
I am going to need a Raspberry Pi 2, either the Zero($5), B($37), or the B+($35). In addition to these things, I will need, a charger($5), a microSD card($5), an HDMI cable($4), a GPS module($40), as well as a breadboard with wires and a connection board($10).

## Conclusion
This project, besides providing me with the opportunity to apply what I know to the physical world, will allow me to have the time and the rescouces to learn more about how to translate ideas from mere concepts into physical reality.
