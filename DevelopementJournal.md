This week I received the raspberry pi along with all of the parts that I need to begin learning Python and setting up the raspberry pi. At the beginning of the week I watched several tutorials on how to navigate the Linux file system. I took notes on the things I learned (CommandsForLinux.md) and also researched the hardware I would need in order to use the raspberry pi. The pi 2 B+ arrived on Wednesday and I was able to begin work on it immediately. I was working on it from 10:45 am to 4:30pm. I read the step by step setup instructions that I found on Adafruit’s website and was able to first set up the automatic Wi-Fi connection on start up. Then I began finding a way to allow the pi to interface with my laptop so that I would be able to use my laptop's screen in collusion with the raspberry pi's graphics. To accomplish this I had to do two things. Set up a SSH terminal(Secure Shell), and then set up a VNC(Virtual Network Connection).

I learned that the raspberry pi B+ is integrated in such a way that Python is the easiest language to program it in. As a result I created a code academy account and have begun learning the Python syntax rules. In addition to learning the extreme basics of Python I began learning about how to create circuits that feature LED lights which I can then light up by running a program in Python. For some unknown reason I have not been successful in getting power to my circuit from the pi but, as a positive, I was able to write a Python program that ran with limited success. It out putted instructions for how to run the program, but did little else, namely not causing the LED's to light up. I have tried completeing one of the basic recommended projects provide by adafruit but with no success. My failure may have been a result of my not activating the SPI interface for the pi. The SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface) provides short range communications between the pi and other connected devices such as my circuit, so perhaps its state of non-activation was the reason my attempts at running a program failed.

##2/19/16
This week I successfully installed the SPI interface on my pi's operating system and also proceeded to continue working on learning python. I learned the syntax for conditionals and began creating a python version of the pig latin translator that we created in comp sci. Midway through the week I began having problems accessing the pi via SSH. I decided to try reinstalling the operating system and starting over again from scratch. However, I began experiencing problems, namely I could not boot from the SDC. I watched all of the tutorials and posted for help on a couple of forums and was eventually successful in reformatting the SDC and installing the operating system. However, when I tried to boot from the SDC again I ran into a string of boot errors. One of the errors mentioned was that the installed operating system was too big for the SDC. This has led me to try to find a smaller OS and install that. This whole process has been slow and extremely frustrating, especially since it has taken hours of debugging to even get on the right track.

##2/26/16
This week I reinstalled the operating system on the pi's SDHC and then I continued to learn python. I primarily learned how to use the funtions in python. Then I began making a pig latin translator in python to further refine my new found skills. By learning how to translate from pig latin into English I learned how to use the string functions supplied by python. I also learned that python is named after Monty Python. Python's implementer, Guido van Rossum, was reading the scripts for Monty Python's Circus at the same time he was working on Python and decided to name his language after the comedy group. Python's syntax is much looser and less specific than Java, something that makes it easy to learn but at the same time harder to read. I personally like Java more than python and may consider doing my project in C instead of Python if I can figure out the GPIO support libraries in C. I will also need to reinstall all of the SPI and I2C libraries on the pi so that I will be able to run python programs and breakout boards on the pi. After reinstalling the operating system I set about reconfiguring the wifi connections and gpio libraries installed on the pi. This went fairly quickly and I was able to move on to working on creating a circuit and trying to program it. I sucessfully ran the program but I have fatal flaws in the area of my circuit.

 I worked on learning more python and was able to hook up the GPS and begin receiving data from it via the terminal. However, I could not get the GPS to get a “fix”, in other words it was unable to figure out where it was. I may need to get an antenna to go on it but hopefully not. I found out that there is a program that I can install which will automatically read the data from the GPS and translate it into coordinates that are easier to understand. I will eventually make my own version of this, but better. I do  not know at this point whether I will be able to finish by the end of the year and it seems like the mountain I have picked for my stroll will become the steepest ascent of my sophomore year. Oh, well. My next step is to find a way to read the inputs from the GPS as they come in and output them using my own program that I will write in python. Once I have that I will have accomplished a major first step. It will be difficult though... Mean while I still have not figured out how to get my circuit to work and I will need to seek the advice of a professional or at the least that of an experienced amateur. From my own tests I have concluded that the LED's are defunct.

This week I worked on setting up the wireless VNC connection with my raspberry pi so that I will be able to program it when it has the GPS hat on it without needing to use the serial ports for a TTL to USB connection. Then I began reading a book by Simon Monk about how to program the raspberry pi. I learned a great deal about how the pi interacts with Python 2 as well as Python 3. His book contained several sections that I found particularly interesting. First, he wrote about how to use Python to read and write data to files, something that I may use in my data collection from the pi. Second, Monk wrote about how to implement simple GUI's. I would like to not only learn how to record the data from the raspberry pi but I would like to learn how to create a GUI that will process the information and present it in a user friendly manner. The tough part will be breaking down the individual tasks into problems that I will be able to tackle with my scanty programming knowledge.

##3/18/16
This week I installed python and began working on how to make my GUI that I will be using for my GPS. It will be very simplistic, and will only supply a few functions that, while basic, should make using the GPS much more efficient and helpful. I still need to figure out how to access the data from the GPS and convert that into a readable form. I may be able to find some software to do it for me but I am not confident that that will end up working out for me. I also learned how to write modules that I can import and use specifically for my project. All I need to do is write a separate module and then import it. I need to learn more about how the file access works and how to write and read files that my program will need to handle. 

##3/25/16
This week I did a large number of things. First, I fixed the connection problem that my GPS was having when it was hooked up to the pi. I would enter the commands to start the GPS data stream and instead of NMEA sentences I would not get anything back. I tried restarting the process a couple of times but in the end was unable to figure out the answer on my own. I posted a question on the vendor's  website and I was told that the RXD and TXD pins were most likely improperly connected to the pi. This was impossible that the pins were not connected to the pi but I tried reconnecting the GPS any way and I found that doing so solved my problem. Now, the suggested solution was still incorrect, but I   did have a faulty connection some where in my system. Anyway, moving on, I then began writing the code to parse the NMEA sentences from the GPS. This presented several problems. First, the GPS sends its output to the command line of the pi. As a result I needed a way to save the NMEA sentences so that my own program could parse through them and return an output.  Second, the pi receives so much data from the GPS that if I was successful in writing the data to a file the file would soon become so large that it would be too unwieldy, and potentially too big for the pi to handle. In short I needed a way to control the flow of data to the file that I am writing. Eventually I found several solutions. For my first problem I found that Python has a module called subprocess which allows the user to run command line arguments while remaining in a python script. This module also allows the user to capture the output of the command that was just run in the script. For my second problem I actually found a person on Stack Overflow who had the same problem and had solved it so I was able to copy his code, making up for my own lack of knowledge.

##3/1/16
I learned that if I want to make the GPS so that it can continue to run while the pi is not connected to a power source, I need to supply the GPS with its own independent power source. Luckily the GPS has a disk battery clip, so that problem is easily solved and I have ordered the batteries which should arrive by the fourth of this month. By adding the battery the GPS hat will be able to search continuously for satelites and obtain a fix of its position even if the raspberry pi is not able to supply the power needed to support that type of continuous search. I also need to begin working on parsing the NMEA sentences, and while I have written some code to begin the data collection and management, I have not been able to test it or begin writing the code that will handle the data parsing, sadly.
