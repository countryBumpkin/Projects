This week I received the raspberry pi along with all of the parts that I need to begin learning Python and setting up the raspberry pi. At the beginning of the week I watched several tutorials on how to navigate the Linux file system. I took notes on the things I learned (CommandsForLinux.md) and also researched the hardware I would need in order to use the raspberry pi. The pi 2 B+ arrived on Wednesday and I was able to begin work on it immediately. I was working on it from 10:45 am to 4:30pm. I read the step by step setup instructions that I found on Adafruitâ€™s website and was able to first set up the automatic Wi-Fi connection on start up. Then I began finding a way to allow the pi to interface with my laptop so that I would be able to use my laptop's screen in collusion with the raspberry pi's graphics. To accomplish this I had to do two things. Set up a SSH terminal(Secure Shell), and then set up a VNC(Virtual Network Connection).
